                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I'm a passionate Software Developer with a creative mindset, based in Sydney.<br /> 
                My dedication to coding brought me to undertake a web development bootcamp - <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><nobr>Le Wagon Melbourne</nobr></a>.<br />
                Throughout this tech journey, I developed a strong interest in front-end development with a focus on the user interface and experience. 
                I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.rea-group.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">REA Group</a>, ranked one of the best places to work in Australia and one of the best workplaces for women. I have been selected for the <a href="https://www.rea-group.com/careers/springboard-to-tech-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><nobr>Springboard to Tech</nobr></a> program where I had the opportunity to learn and work within a large range of tech stacks such as Typescript, React, GraphQL, Kotlin, Scala, AWS & more, through 2 rotations, in 12 months.<br />
                I'm passionate, value my strong work ethic, promote Fair go and am environmentally conscious. In addition, I'm constantly looking for growth and learning opportunities.</p>
